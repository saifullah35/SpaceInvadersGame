Our program that we are going to try to complete for this project is a recreation of Space Invaders. 
Our program will consist of two parts. The first part of our game will be a single player mode with a battleship behind shields protecting the 
player from enemy ships that will be shooting at them. The player will be able to use the keyboard to shoot at the enemy ships and gain points.
The top five scores a user achieves after playing will be displayed on a leaderboard, with a message each time the player beats their previous 
score.
The other mode will be a two player game mode with the same functionality, except players will take turns in a best of five series trying to 
collect more points than their opponents. Players will be distinguished by different colored battle ships, and allow each player to enter a 
nickname for the leaderboard. The top five scores between the two players will also be displayed on the leaderboard.

250 Point breakdown and rough schedule:

One player mode GUI - 25 points

Two player mode GUI - 25 points - **Finish both layouts by April 17**.

Shields and ability to be broken down - 30 points 

Players' Ships ability to shoot and be destroyed - 30 points

Aliens to shoot and be destroyed - 30 points - **Finish this section by April 21.**

Enemy ships and ability to shoot and ability to be destroyed - 30 points

Two player ability to move around and shoot at each other (*Learn about ability of co-op playing*) - 50 points -
**Finish these two sections by April 28.** 

*These two milestones will be considered vital for out project to be considered a success because 
of the time it will take to learn the ability to allow for both players to play at once, and the ability to implement all of the enemy ships 
and functionality*.

Scoreboard and leaderboard display for player one mode - 15 points

Scoreboard and leaderboard for two player mode - 15 points -
**Finish these sections by May 2.**
